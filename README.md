# ALTIMETER

Armature Data Handling Device (ADHD XD) is an open-source, modular system designed for reliable data acquisition, logging, and telemetry in aerospace and high-altitude environments.
It integrates multiple sensors (IMU, barometer, GPS, and environmental units) with onboard storage and communication modules (LoRa, UART, SPI), providing a robust foundation for research, rocketry, and environmental monitoring projects.

The repository includes all essential resources — firmware, schematic files, PCB layout, and mechanical CAD — making it fully reproducible, hackable, and suitable for both academic and experimental development.
